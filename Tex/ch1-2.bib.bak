	abstract = {There are several aspects of the international business environment which affect the setting of a transfer price. These items include the various methods and rates of income taxation; quotas and duties imposed on imported materials; capital flow restrictions and currency regulations imposed by a host government; and managerial preferences for risk avoidance through consideration of risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations, rates of inflation and nationalization. Also, the behavioral dimension of managerial rewards and controls must be considered in the transfer pricing problem. Since transfer prices usually cannot be set to accomplish all of these goals simultaneously, some means must be devised by which the firm's multiple objectives are optimized. In this vein, the transfer pricing problem is formulated in both a single-objective and a multiple-objective approach for comparison purposes. Specifically, the transfer pricing problem is couched in both a linear programming and a goal programming framework to allow for the optimization of differing tax rates, profit requirements, and exposure and nationalization risks around the world.},

Readers agree, saying it's exactly "what I need to know" and calling it a "must-read" for decision makers without expertise in finance. Since its release in 2006, "Financial Intelligence" has become a favorite among managers who need a guided tour through the numbers--helping them to understand not only what the numbers really mean, but also why they matter. This new, completely updated edition brings the numbers up to date and continues to teach the basics of finance to managers who need to use financial data to drive their business. It also addresses issues that have become even more important in recent years--including questions around the financial crisis and those around broader financial and accounting literacy. Accessible, jargon-free, and filled with entertaining stories of real companies, Financial Intelligence gives nonfinancial managers the confidence to understand the nuance beyond the numbers--to help bring everyday work to a new level."--Publisher's website.},
