\section{Introduction}
Global Supply Chain Management is probably one of the most used terms when we talk about how the firms are running their business nowadays. GSCM may be defined as the allocation of goods and services along a series of transnational companies's global network to maximize profits and minimize waste. Inside this very wide concept we can find the concept of logistics which is in charge of the movement of goods, service and last but not least information from the sourcing of raw material, till it reaches the end costumer.
Along with theese two concepts a third one sticked with them, the concept of Green Supply Chain (GSC). This concept brougth into light by a more adavanced concern about environmental matters of the western countries forced the firms to be accountable for their negative externalities related to the evirnoment in which they operate. However such legislations lack from a point of view of legal contraints (setting only few qualitative restriction, poorly measurable) leaving some dregrees of freedom to the firms, is also important to notice the trend that is affecting such legislations, a trend that in the future may require firms to set particular frameworks to be accountable for their enviromental impact.

Because of that we propose a Goal Programming model in order to address such problem, following what proposed by ... we try to enhanche suh model fixing quantitative constraints to the pollution generated by the production activity invoveld in the creation of a good in our case a a networking electronic component (i.e. hub, switch or ruter). In order to measure such impact we'll use the framework used by Activity Based Costing in order to asses the marginal environmental impact of any additional unit elaborarated by the trans national firms in order to ultimately market the product on its reference market.
