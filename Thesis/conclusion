As highlithed by the two models proposed Goal Programming indeed may turn out to be a great tool in the hands of the Decison Maker, Becuse of that is largely applied by Supply Chain professionals and academics to model different problems they may face. The same cannot be said when the topics shifts and from Supply Chain we start dealing with international tax planning proble, as suggested before this may be due to the specific skills that such practitioner has on this field. Becuse of that is importat to renew the call to action to model in a greater way these problems, which in most of the cases boil down to multi objectives problems that can be solved through Goal Programming.

THis thesis wouldn't have been possibe without the R project, their packages provided a good link between models built in LINGO and AMPL and solved (in case of the Green Supply Chain model) using a cloud server provider of solvers such as Neos. I also thanks my Supervisor and Co-Supervisor because they helped me understand the problem better in a mathematical way and also provided me with tips and tricks in modelling some occurences.

Last but not leas I would like to thank the practitioner that helped me shaping the model of international taxation their help was so much usefull as the information they provided me for the case study.
