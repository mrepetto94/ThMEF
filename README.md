# ThMEF
A git repository for the master thesis I wrote on Multi-criteria Analysis. The thesis was about building two transportation models:
* A model for profit allocation in multinationals;
* A model on Green Supply Chain management;

Both the models were created using the Goal Programming approach.

## In brief
Starting from the concept of Multi-criteria optimization, which is defined as:
<p align="center"><img src="/tex/5b5b63ed54a737939d1ec5463c8d5ee1.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=398.11708035pt height=16.438356pt/></p>
Then the general Goal Promming formulation is given, which takes the following optimization form:
<p align="center"><img src="/tex/501672697bc87933f768ee548aeb40e0.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=233.95697654999998pt height=100.47478319999999pt/></p>

The advantage of GP is that can be solved through LP solvers and in its weighted flavor allow for the direct tradeoff between objectives.
